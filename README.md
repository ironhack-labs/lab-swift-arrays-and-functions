# Lab | Arrays and Functions

<br>

## Introduction

Labs are mandatory and must be completed before the start of the next class. 
You may work collaboratively with your classmates, but you may not copy and paste another student's code.

## Requirements

- Fork this repository.
<!-- - Add your instructor and the class graders to your repository and ensure that your repository is private. Public repositories will receive a zero on the assignment.
  - If you are unsure who your class graders are, ask your instructor or refer to the day 1 slide deck. -->
- Upload the code for all of the following prompts to your repository.

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```shell
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin main
  ```

- Create a Pull Request

When you make pull request in pair-programming: `student1,student2-nameOfTheExercise` <br>
When you make pull request in individual-programming: `student-nameOfTheExercise`

<br>

## Starter code

No starter code needed/provided.

<br>

## Iterations

### Iteration 1

Create a function in Swift that returns the smallest value in an array of integers. The length of the array must be 1 and above.

### Iteration 2

Create a function in Swift that returns the largest value in an array of integers. The length of the array must be 1 and above.

### Iteration 3

Create a function in Swift that returns the difference between the largest and smallest values in an array of integers. The length of the array must be 1 and above.

### Iteration 4

Create a function in Swift to find the smallest and second smallest elements of a given array of integers, and print it in the console.

### Iteration 5 (Bonus)

Create a function in Swift that returns the copy of a String after replacing a character of the String at a specific index. The function takes a String, an index and a character as arguments. Print the result in the console.

### Iteration 6 (Bonus)

Create a function in Swift that return the sorted copy of an array of integers, sorted from smallest to largest.

Happy coding! :heart:
